# Simple Object Pooler
An example project demonstrating two object pooling systems. 

The code started with the twin stick example from [this example project](https://github.com/hunterdyar/UnitySimpleCharacterControllers), included.

The first example pooler is in the TwinStickWeaponManager.cs class.
The second, a more "generic" solution is simply called GenericObjectPooler.cs.
